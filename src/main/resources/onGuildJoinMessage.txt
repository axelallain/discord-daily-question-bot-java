**Hello, thank you for adding me!** :partying_face:
My goal is to send your random questions **every day at 7 AM**.
The questions are sent as a private message.
The answers will be posted publicly on the server.
```
!welcome    :    Set the current channel as Welcome channel.

!answers    :    Set the current channel as Answers channel.

!questions  :    Get all the questions for this server.

!add        :    Add your question to the random daily list.
                 Example : !add How old are you?


Make a private channel to add your questions without **SPOILING!**
```
If you want to access this list again, use **!help**
